# GadJet.jl

# This is not an official release!

If you stumbled on this repository by chance: <br>
Feel free to use any function you find useful and/or working. <br>
Please be aware that this is a work in progress and I'm only uploading this to have reasonable version control and maybe find collaborators. <br>
So far the code can read Gadget files of format 2, with or without INFO block. With INFO block works better though! <br>
Snap format 1 can also be read, but only in the most basic physics usage. You can read positions, velocities, ids and so on. <br>
