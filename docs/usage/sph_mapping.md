SPH mapping
===========


Internal Module
---------------
You can map SPH data to a grid using the function:

```julia
function sphMapping(Pos, HSML, M, œÅ, Bin_Quant;
		            param::mappingParameters,
					kernel::SPHKernel,
		            show_progress::Bool=true,
				    conserve_quantities::Bool=true,
				    dimensions::Int=2)

	[...]

end
```

### Setup
To map the data you need to define the mapping parameters via the `mappingParameters` object:

```julia
par = mappingParameters(xlim=[xmin, xmax], ylim=[ymin, ymax], zlim=[zmin, zmax],
						Npixels=200)
```
Instead of Npixels you can also give the keyword argument `pixelSideLength` if you prefer to define your image that way.

You also need to choose the kernel you used in the simulation. I implemented the following ones:

```julia
k = Cubic()
k = Quintic()
k = WendlandC4()
k = WendlandC6()
```

### Mapping
With the setup done you can now map (e.g.) density of your data using the function above as:

```julia
image = sphMapping(x, hsml, m, rho, rho, param=par, kernel=k)
```

Replacing the second `rho` with any other quantity would map that quantity of course.
Please note: This function doesn't do any unit conversion for you, so you need to convert to the desired units beforehand. See the chapter on unit conversion for usage.

Image now contains a 2D array with the binned data and can easily be plotted with `imshow()` from any plotting package of your choosing.

### Conserved quantities

With the latest release you can map the particles to a grid while also conserving the particle volume, following the algorithm described in Dolag et. al. 2006 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2005MNRAS.363...29D/doi:10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09452.x).

This is switched on by default, but is slightly more expensive than simple mapping. If you don't want to use it simply call the mapping function with `conserve_quantities=false`.


External Programs
-----------------
GadJet.jl provides helper function for two external sph mapping Codes: Smac and P-Smac2.

### P-Smac2
P-Smac2 by Julius Donnert (https://github.com/jdonnert/Smac2) is an advanced mapping code for a multitude of different quantities. To run a mapping and plotting loop from a Julia script you need to update the parameter files on the fly.
The function `write_smac2_par` provides this functionality.

```julia
write_smac2_par(x, y, z,
                euler_angle_0, euler_angle_1, euler_angle_2,
                xy_size, z_depth, xy_pix::Int64,
                input_file, output_file, path,
                effect_module::Int64=0, effect_flag::Int64=0)
```

### Smac
Smac isn't public unfortunately. So these functions are just for my personal use.
